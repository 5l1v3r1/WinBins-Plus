Repo to store Windows PE's and Utilities for easy access.
----------------------------------------------------------

I decided to create this repo as a place to store a number of Windows PE's, Utilities and Tools for easy access. When deploying a new Windows install i usually spend a good amount of time simply installing the tools i need. I can eb a little unorganized at times as well, so i figured i'd put these here to save myself a lot of hassle.

Furthermore, i intend to create what essentially amounts to a bootstrapping script for Windows somewhere in the near future. Programatically gathering the required resources should be more efficient as well by virtue of this repo.

### Note

The credits for the utilities in this repo go to their original authors, as stated, this is simply a list curated by me for convenience sake.

Regardless, should you have any questions surrounding the contents of this repo please feel free to open a ticket.
