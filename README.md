Repo to store Windows PE's and Utilities for easy access.
----------------------------------------------------------

This repo was created as a place to store a number of Windows PE's, Utilities and Tools for easy access. When deploying a new Windows install i usually spend a good amount of time simply looking for and installing the tools i need. I can be a little disorganized at times, so i figured i'd put these here to save myself a lot of hassle. It may save you a bit of hassle as well, if you're looking for something specific.

Furthermore, i intend to create what essentially amounts to a bootstrapping script for Windows somewhere in the near future. Programatically gathering the required resources for thatn upcoming project should be more efficient as well by virtue of having these things in a nice centralized place.

### Note

The credits for the utilities in this repo go to their original authors, as stated, this is a list curated by me for convenience.

Regardless, should you have any questions surrounding the contents of this repo please feel free to open a ticket.
