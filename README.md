Repo to store Windows PE's and Utilities for easy access.
----------------------------------------------------------

This repo was created as a place to store a number of Windows PE's, Utilities and Tools for easy access. When deploying a new Windows install i usually spend a good amount of time simply looking for and installing the tools i need. I can be a little disorganized at times, so i figured i'd put these here to save myself a lot of hassle. It might save you a bit of hassle as well, if you're looking for something specific.

Furthermore, i intend to create what essentially amounts to a bootstrapping script for Windows somewhere in the near future. Programatically gathering the required resources for that upcoming project should be more efficient as well by virtue of having these in a centralized place.

### Note

The credits for the utilities in this repo go to their original authors of course, as stated, this is just a list curated by me for convenience.

Regardless, should you have any questions surrounding the contents and/or purpose of this repo please feel free to open a ticket.
